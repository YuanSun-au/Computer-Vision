# Computer-Vision

### [cv19/ex01](./cv19/ex01):
- Edge detection
- Hough transform (detection of circles)

    for compilation and execution instructions see [cv19/ex01/makefile](./cv19/ex01/makefile)


# Correspondence Problems in Computer-Vision

### [copcv19/ex01](./cv19/ex01):
- SSD block matching algorithm with occlusion detection (find pixel correlation between images)

    to run, simply execute the [./cv19/ex01/main](./cv19/ex01/main) file with the following arguments:

    > ./main "IMAGE1".pgm "IMAGE2".pgm "ZOOM_RATIO"
    
    such as:

    > ./main ./img/tsu1.pgm ./img/tsu2.pgm 1
    >
    > ./main ./img/yos1.pgm ./img/yos2.pgm 1
